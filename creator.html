<p>
        I would like to wish you a very happy birthday. you are 22 years old now. you're an old, old man. elderly even. PREHISTORIC.
        </p>
        <p>
        
        I have known you for approximately a year now and it's been the best fucking year of my life. you've made me feel like a billion times happy , less depressed and mentally at peace as well. I'm a lot less worried about things when I'm with you. if I do have any worries or anything that troubles me I just have to talk to you. even if it's not a long stretched talk about the topic just a small ,mini , tiny conversation is enough to uplift me. you are one of the few living things that has not done anything to harm me or hurt me in anyway. like you genuinely care about me. you never make me feel inferior to you in anyway. you never make me feel bad or hurt or sad or in pain. you do the opposite. I honestly didn't know people could be like you.so kind and so sweet and so honest.
        </p>
        <p>
        i have called you "a man written by a woman" once or twice, or maybe more. when men write male characters for books or movies or shows or whatever , they make them overly agressive , mean and basically unbothered about the woman. they are mean and condesending about a shit ton of stuff but the girls still fall for them. red flags. anyway. when women write books its different, the guys are actually nice, sweet, caring. theye're intouch with their emotions and love the female lead till they basically die. anyway your written by a woman and God bless then woman that wrote you.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have never been the most perfect human being and you know that and you still love me and adore me and care for me. and I thank you for that. you've never made me feel bad or hurt mentally or physically and I thank you for that again angel. weirdly that's why I call you angel. because you are one. the living embodiment of one. and you're my angel.
        </p>
        
        <p>you make me so happy about everything, including myself. ive always hated my glasses since he day i got them. then i got my braces and i hate that too. and the combo of the two i hated them so much. but then i met you in like august/september and told me you like that combination. that whole "horni nerd" thing. ive liked them a lot more since. idk man overall you've just made me feel a lot more happy and confident and thank you for that, so much.
        </p>
        <p>but enough about me. i could go on and on about how you make me feel and how im so happy because of you. lets talk about you now, my beautiful, delicious boy. </p>
